# Cooperation Simulations

Two simulations that model cooperation in different ways. 
Purpose is the [DSA Urspring 2018, course 4.3](https://secure.bildung-und-begabung.de/download/2018/Ausschreibung/DSA_Programm_2018.pdf).

## Symbiosis Model

A simple difference equations model to simulate two species, living in symbiosis based on [this lecture script](https://www-m6.ma.tum.de/Lehrstuhl/MathBioWS1213).

Stationary Points you can play with (with respect to the current model parameters):
- (0,0) - no individuals at all
- (0.5,0) / (0,0.5) - only one species is alive and peaks at the capacity of the environment
- (x, y) - coexistence point, stabilising around (0.6,0.6) i.e. in symbiosis both species can grow over the capacity of their environment
